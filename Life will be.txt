So many days, you hid the truth
Prayin' for that moment and someone to believe in you
Get out your way, 'cause time won't wait for you
Live your life, live your life

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see the sadness in your eyes
But I can see the magic in your life
But they don't know
That it took you your whole life to rediscover
You're only here to love and to be free

[Chorus]
Oh, life will be
Just you believe in you
Oh, life will be
Just you believe in you

[Verse 2]
If you're alive, there's no excuse
God gave you a gift that you don't know yet had a use
Get out your mind, you cannot lose this one time
It could be right

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see the hope that's in your eyes
I can see the magic in your life
But they don't know
That it took you your whole life to rediscover
Try find your purpose before you leave
