War

Do you remember standing a broken field
White crippled wings beating the
The harbingersof war with their nature revealed
And our chancesflowing by

If Ican let the heal
I will remember you with me on that field

When I thought that I fought this war alone
You were there by my side on the frontline
When I thought that I fought without a
You gave me a to try

Turn page I need tosee something new
For now my innocence istorn
We cannot linger on this stunted view
Like rabid dogs ofwar

I will let the memory heal
I'll remember you with me on that field

When I thought thatIfought this war alone
You were there bymysideon the frontline
the
impossibleWhen I thoughtthatI foughtthiswar alone
We were one withourdestinies entwined
When I thought that we foughtwithout a cause
the reason why

With noonewearingtheir real face
It's
I'veonlygotmybrittle
bonesTo break the fall

When love in letters fade
It's like
movinginslowmotionAndwe're already too lateifwe arriveatall

And the
raceAn involuntary
addictionAnd we're shedding every value our mothers

So willyou please show me your real face
Draw line in horizon
'Cos I only need you
nameTocall the reasons why I fought

When I thought that I fought this war alone...
