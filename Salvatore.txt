All the lights in Miami begin to glow
Ruby, blue and green, neon too
Everything looks better from above, my king
Like aquamarine ocean’s blue

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Cacciatore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Limousines.
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ciao, amore.
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Soft ice cream

All the lights are sparkling for you it seems
On the downtown scenes, shady blue
Beatboxing and rapping in the summer rain

Like a boss, he sang jazz and blues

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Cacciatore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Limousines
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ciao, amore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Soft ice cream

The summer’s hot
And I’ve been waiting for you all this time
I adore you, can’t you see,
You’re meant for me?
Summer’s hot but I’ve been cold without you
I was so wrong not to tell
I’m in regine, tangerine dreams

Catch me if you can
Working on my tan
Salvatore
Dying by the hand
Of a foreign man
Happily
Calling out my name
In the summer rain
Ciao amore
Salvatore can wait
Now it’s time to eat
Soft ice cream

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Cacciatore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Limousines
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ciao, amore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Soft ice cream
